**Introduction**

The \`Multiparamtools\` GitHub repository serves as a showcase for
sample code related to LangChain agents and tools. LangChain agents are
robust utilities designed to construct Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) interfaces, facilitating seamless integration with various
platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, Yahoo
Finance, SQL databases, and vector stores. Additionally, LangChain
agents can interface with specialized Language Learning Models (LLMs).

By leveraging the capabilities of RAG, you can significantly expand the
knowledge base of your LLM, thereby enhancing its performance and
utility.

This version aims to be more formal and structured, providing a clearer
understanding of what \`Multiparamtools\` and LangChain agents are, as
well as the benefits of using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

**Example**

The \`yahooftools.py\` script serves as a practical guide for
configuring a list of tools that can be integrated with a Language
Learning Model (LLM). In this particular example, the agent type
employed is \`STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION\`. The sample
code illustrates how to set up a tool or function with multiple
parameters. Additionally, the script includes an example that
demonstrates how to supply instance-specific data to the tool function.
